# Random Name Picker

For use in a classroom. Or anywhere.

Just a quick-and-dirty tool I made to make it easy and fun to randomly select students for activities.

Names are only shown once and then removed from subsequent random draws.
It's designed to be used with a presentation clicker -
right arrow key progresses to the next name, left arrow key refreshes the list and starts over.
